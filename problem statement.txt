e-Education
As the world shifts to online learning, teachers are struggling to motivate disengaged students remotely.
 We are looking for innovative solutions to tackle these challenges and improve the remote education experience, and allow 
 users to continue without disruption even in events like snow days, natural disasters, or the COVID-19 pandemic, 
 that force schools and universities to close down.

Design solutions that would improve and lift up the educational sector of the nation and encourage people to learn new skills
 by developing applications on improving the rate of the skill. Propose and execute moonshot ideas to help learners of various 
 universities and research institutes across the world to learn online.
